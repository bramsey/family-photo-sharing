# Family Photo Sharing

This is a web app I developed for my family to share and comment on photos.  It was a christmas gift to my step-dad with the goal of creating a regular stream of photos from the family intending to make him smile.  So far it's working well.

All pictures post to the main page, and users can comment on pictures.  The layout uses jQuery masonry (http://masonry.desandro.com/) to dynamically position the images.
